This study has been designed to investigate of computer-based stress inoculation training (SIT) counseling approach on anxiety, depression, and stress of university students with PMS. Methods: A randomized trial study with two parallel arms was done from 30 October 2022 to 21 June 2023 on 100 university students aged 18 to 38 at Babol University of Medical Sciences. The participants were randomly divided into two groups intervention and control. The data collection tools included questionnaires on demographic-fertility characteristics, the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and Riff’s Psychological Well-being Scale (RPWS). The data were assessed using chi-square, t-student, ANOVA repeated measure, and linear regression tests. A significance level of P < 0.05 was considered for the analysis. Results: The results of the study showed that the SIT interventions decreased the PMS severity and most psychological factors so in the intervention group, SIT was able to significantly reduce anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and Sheehan’s disability after intervention (P < 0.001). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, the most predictors of HADS were the PSS and SDS (β = 0.285, p = 0.009 and β = 0.236, p = 0.024, respectively). Conclusion: The computer-based SIT counseling approach could reduce the severity of symptoms and psychological factors in students. Therefore, SIT intervention is recommended to manage their PMS.

In fact, today they have become an essential and seemingly irreplaceable tool in quantum field theory calculations. In this article, we propose to explore the development of computational methods for Feynman diagrams with a special focus on their automation, drawing insights from both theoretical physics and the history of science. From the latter perspective, the article particularly investigates the emergence of computer algebraic programs, such as the pioneering SCHOONSCHIP, REDUCE, and ASHMEDAI, designed to handle the intricate calculations associated with Feynman diagrams. This sheds light on the many challenges faced by physicists when working at higher orders in perturbation theory and reveal, as exemplified by the test of the validity of quantum electrodynamics at the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, the indispensable necessity of computer-assisted procedures. In the second part of the article, a comprehensive overview of the current state of the algorithmic evaluation of Feynman diagrams is presented from a theoretical point of view. It emphasizes the key algorithmic concepts employed in modern perturbative quantum field theory computations and discusses the achievements, ongoing challenges, and potential limitations encountered in the application of the Feynman diagrammatic method. Accordingly, we attribute the enduring significance of Feynman diagrams in contemporary physics to two main factors: the highly algorithmic framework developed by physicists to tackle these diagrams and the successful advancement of algebraic programs used to process the involved calculations associated with them. © The Author(s) 2024.",,,,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (FOR 2063)",This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Research Unit “The Epistemology of the Large Hadron Collider” (Grant FOR 2063). ,"Schweber S.S., QED and the men who made it: Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga, (1994);

Therefore, this study aims to identify the prevalence of computer vision syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted using the databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase up to February 22, 2023, using the search terms ""Computer Vision Syndrome"" and ""COVID-19"". Three authors independently performed study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument was used to evaluate study quality. Heterogeneity was assessed using the statistical test I2, and the R version 4.2.3 program was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 192 studies were retrieved, of which 18 were included in the final meta-analysis. The total sample included 10,337 participants from 12 countries. The combined prevalence of computer vision syndrome was 74% (95% CI: 66, 81). Subgroup analysis based on country revealed a higher prevalence of computer vision syndrome in Pakistan (99%, 95% CI: 97, 100) and a lower prevalence in Turkey (48%, 95% CI: 44, 52). In addition, subgroup analysis based on study subjects showed a prevalence of 82% (95% CI: 74, 89) for computer vision syndrome in non-students and 70% (95% CI: 60, 80) among students. Conclusion: According to the study, 74% of the participants experienced computer vision syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this finding, it is essential to implement preventive and therapeutic measures to reduce the risk of developing computer vision syndrome and improve the quality of life of those affected. Trial registration: The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in the international registry of systematic reviews, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with registration number CRD42022345965. © The Author(s) 2024.",And Pandemic;

Methods: This study followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). A comprehensive search of online databases/search tools (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Ovid, and Google Scholar) was conducted for all relevant studies published up until May 29, 2023. Only in-vitro studies comparing the adherence of Candida albicans to the digital and conventional acrylic resins were included. The quantitative analyses were performed using RevMan v5.3 software. Results: Fourteen studies were included, 11 of which were meta-analyzed based on Colony Forming Unit (CFU) and Optical Density (OD) outcome measures. The pooled data revealed significantly lower candida colonization on the milled digitally-fabricated compared to the heat-polymerized conventionally-fabricated acrylic resin materials (MD = − 0.36; 95%CI = − 0.69, − 0.03; P = 0.03 and MD = − 0.04; 95%CI = − 0.06, − 0.01; P = 0.0008; as measured by CFU and OD respectively). However, no differences were found in the adhesion of Candida albicans between the 3D-printed digitally-fabricated compared to the heat-polymerized conventionally-fabricated acrylic resin materials (CFU: P = 0.11, and OD: P = 0.20). Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that candida is less likely to adhere to the milled digitally-fabricated acrylic resins compared to the conventional ones. © The Author(s) 2024.",Acrylic resin;

Bioinformatics is evolving as a union field between computer Science and biology, enabling the representation, storage, management, analysis and exploration of many types of data with a plethora of machine learning algorithms and computing tools. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to detect differentially expressed genes between different types of cancer and showing the existence overlap to final results from RNA-sequencing analysis. The datasets were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information resource. Specifically, dataset GSE68086 which corresponds to PMID:200,068,086. This dataset consists of 171 blood platelet samples collected from patients with six different tumors and healthy individuals. All steps for RNA-sequencing analysis (preprocessing, read alignment, transcriptome reconstruction, expression quantification and differential expression analysis) were followed. Machine Learning- based Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms were applied to predict significant genes. The Rstudio statistical tool was used for the analysis. © The Author(s) 2024.",Bioconductor; Differentially expressed genes; Gene expression; Machine learning; NGS data; RNA-seq analysis; Supervised;

This study aims to investigate one of the aspects which can help to retain our students. It is vital to examine CS education on the challenge of competence transition within the BSc curriculum from faculty perspectives. Teachers’ expectations about students’ skills and knowledge are important to understand because they influence learning outcomes and teaching methodologies. Acquiring hard skills and professional skills has outstanding significance in preparing students for their future careers. This study uses Q-methodology to identify the different viewpoints on the skills necessary to obtain a CS degree. Teachers from CS bachelor’s programmes at a large European university participated in the study and shared their opinions. The participants were asked to rank the statements along a spectrum of “the most important skill” to “unimportant skill” (containing hard skills as well as soft skills). Factor analysis revealed five factors that are key components to obtaining a degree in CS: 1. analytical and technical skills, 2. teamwork and self-study experience, 3. group programming experience, 4. communication and problem-solving skills, 5. mathematical foundations and process modelling ability. This exploratory study applied a new research instrument and approach to incorporate teachers’ perspectives into research and practice.

Paranasal sinuses like frontal and maxillary sinuses, are resistant to trauma and can aid profiling. We developed a deep learning (DL) model optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (genetic algorithm/GA) to determine sex and age using paranasal sinus parameters based on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: Two hundred and forty CBCT images (including 129 females and 111 males, aged 18–52) were included in this study. CBCT images were captured using the Newtom3G device with specific exposure parameters. These images were then analyzed in ITK-SNAP 3.6.0 beta software to extract four paranasal sinus parameters: height, width, length, and volume for both the frontal and maxillary sinuses. A hybrid model, Genetic Algorithm-Deep Neural Network (GADNN), was proposed for feature selection and classification. Traditional statistical methods and machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), and deep learning (DL) were evaluated for their performance. The synthetic minority oversampling technique was used to deal with the unbalanced data. Results: GADNN showed superior accuracy in both sex determination (accuracy of 86%) and age determination (accuracy of 68%), outperforming other models. Also, DL and RF were the second and third superior methods in sex determination (accuracy of 78% and 71% respectively) and age determination (accuracy of 92% and 57%). Conclusions: The study introduces a novel approach combining DL and GA to enhance sex determination and age determination accuracy. The potential of DL in forensic dentistry is highlighted, demonstrating its efficiency in improving accuracy for sex determination and age determination. The study contributes to the burgeoning field of DL in dentistry and forensic sciences. © The Author(s) 2024.",Artificial intelligence; Dentistry; Forensic dentistry; Forensic science; Genetic algorithm;

A structured and controlled data collection process is essential to unlock the full potential of this information. While wearable sensors for physical activity monitoring have gained significant traction in healthcare, sports science, and fitness applications, securing diverse and comprehensive datasets for research and algorithm development poses a notable challenge. In this proof-of-concept study, we underscore the significance of semantic representation in enhancing data interoperability and facilitating advanced analytics for physical activity sensor observations. Our approach focuses on enhancing the usability of physical activity datasets by employing a medical-grade (CE certified) sensor to generate synthetic datasets. Additionally, we provide insights into ethical considerations related to synthetic datasets. The study conducts a comparative analysis between real and synthetic activity datasets, assessing their effectiveness in mitigating model bias and promoting fairness in predictive analysis. We have created an ontology for semantically representing observations from physical activity sensors and conducted predictive analysis on data collected using MOX2-5 activity sensors. Until now, there has been a lack of publicly available datasets for physical activity collected with MOX2-5 activity monitoring medical grade (CE certified) device. The MOX2-5 captures and transmits high-resolution data, including activity intensity, weight-bearing, sedentary, standing, low, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, as well as steps per minute. Our dataset consists of physical activity data collected from 16 adults (Male: 12; Female: 4) over a period of 30–45 days (approximately 1.5 months), yielding a relatively small volume of 539 records. To address this limitation, we employ various synthetic data generation methods, such as Gaussian Capula (GC), Conditional Tabular General Adversarial Network (CTGAN), and Tabular General Adversarial Network (TABGAN), to augment the dataset with synthetic data. For both the authentic and synthetic datasets, we have developed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classification model for accurately classifying daily physical activity levels. The findings underscore the effectiveness of semantic ontology in semantic search, knowledge representation, data integration, reasoning, and capturing meaningful relationships between data. The analysis supports the hypothesis that the efficiency of predictive models improves as the volume of additional synthetic training data increases. Ontology and Generative AI hold the potential to expedite advancements in behavioral monitoring research. The data presented, encompassing both real MOX2-5 and its synthetic counterpart, serves as a valuable resource for developing robust methods in activity type classification. Furthermore, it opens avenues for exploration into research directions related to synthetic data, including model efficiency, detection of generated data, and considerations regarding data privacy. © The Author(s) 2024.",Gaussian Capula; General adversarial network; MOX2-5; Multilayer perceptron; Semantic ontology; Semantic sensor network; Synthetic data in healthcare,"Adult; Algorithms; Exercise; Female; Human Activities; Humans; Male; Neural Networks, Computer; Semantics; adult; algorithm; article; daily life activity; data integration; data interoperability; data privacy; fairness; female; generative artificial intelligence; human; male; mobile phone; multilayer perceptron; ontology; physical activity; predictive model; proof of concept; reasoning; sensor; sports science; wearable device; wearable sensor; weight bearing",,,,,"Universitetet i Agder, UiA","Open access funding provided by University of Agder.

The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for nosocomial intestinal resection in patients with AMVT. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 64 patients with AMVT diagnosed by CTA at the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology from January 2013 to December 2021. We compared patients who underwent intestinal resection (42 patients) with those who did not undergo intestinal resection (22 patients). The area under the ROC curve was evaluated, and a forest map was drawn. Results: Among the 64 patients, 6 (9.38%) had a fever, 60 (93.75%) had abdominal pain, 9 (14.06%) had a history of diabetes, 8 (12.5%) had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and 25 (39.06%) had ascites suggested by B ultrasound or CT after admission. The mean age of all patients was 49.86 ± 16.25 years. The mean age of the patients in the enterectomy group was 47.71 ± 16.20 years. The mean age of the patients in the conservative treatment group (without enterectomy) was 53.95 ± 15.90 years. In the univariate analysis, there were statistically significant differences in leukocyte count (P = 0.003), neutrophil count (P = 0.001), AST (P = 0.048), total bilirubin (P = 0.047), fibrinogen (P = 0.022) and DD2 (P = 0.024) between the two groups. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that admission white blood cell count (OR = 1.153, 95% CI: 1.039–1.280, P = 0.007) was an independent risk factor for intestinal resection in patients with AMVT. The ROC curve showed that the white blood cell count (AUC = 0.759 95% CI: 0.620–0.897; P = 0.001; optimal threshold: 7.815; sensitivity: 0.881; specificity: 0.636) had good predictive value for emergency enterectomy for AMVT. Conclusions: Among patients with AMVT, patients with a higher white blood cell count at admission were more likely to have intestinal necrosis and require emergency enterectomy. This study is helpful for clinicians to accurately determine whether emergency intestinal resection is needed in patients with AMVT after admission, prevent further intestinal necrosis, and improve the prognosis of patients. © The Author(s) 2024.",Acute mesenteric vein thrombosis; Enterectomy; White blood cell count,bilirubin; fibrinogen; bilirubin; fibrinogen; acute mesenteric vein thrombosis; adult; area under the curve; Article; B scan; computed tomographic angiography; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; diabetes mellitus; female; hospital admission; human; human cell; intestine resection; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; mesenteric vein thrombosis; neutrophil count; population research; postoperative period; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; abdominal pain; acute abdomen; article; ascites; diagnosis; fever; forest; intestine necrosis; mesenteric ischemia; mesenteric vein thrombosis; middle aged; predictive value; prognosis; retrospective study; surgery,,"bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; fibrinogen, 9001-32-5",,,"Joint Fund of Yunnan Province, China, (202001AY070001-131); Analysis and Testing Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology","Funding text 1: This study was supported by the Joint Fund of Yunnan Province, China (202001AY070001-131). ; Funding text 2: Thanks to the Department of General Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, for supporting this research data.","Bala M., Kashuk J., Moore E.E., Kluger Y., Biffl W., Gomes C.A., Ben-Ishay O., Rubinstein C., Balogh Z.J., Civil I., Coccolini F., Leppaniemi A., Peitzman A., Ansaloni L., Sugrue M., Sartelli M., Di Saverio S., Fraga G.P., Catena F., Acute mesenteric ischemia: guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery, World J Emerg Surg, 12, (2017); Burch J., Enofe I., Acute mesenteric ischaemia secondary to portal, splenic and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, BMJ Case Rep, 12, 9, (2019); Lauro A., Lacaille F., Short bowel syndrome in children and adults: from rehabilitation to transplantation, Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol, 13, 1, pp. 55-70, (2019); Salim S., Zarrouk M., Elf J., Gottsater A., Ekberg O., Acosta S., Improved prognosis and low failure rate with anticoagulation as first-line therapy in mesenteric venous thrombosis, World J Surg, 42, 11, pp. 3803-3811, (2018); Acosta S., Salim S., Management of Acute Mesenteric venous thrombosis: a systematic review of Contemporary studies, Scand J Surg, 110, 2, pp. 123-129, (2021); Liu D., Ye Y., Xie Q., Yin M., Yang X., Liang B., Wang S., [Predictive factors of intestinal necrosis in acute mesenteric vascular occlusive diseases], Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi, 20, 7, pp. 787-791, (2017); Corcos O., Nuzzo A., Gastro-intestinal vascular emergencies, Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol, 27, 5, pp. 709-725, (2013); Karkkainen J.M., Acosta S., Acute mesenteric ischemia (part I) - incidence, etiologies, and how to improve early diagnosis, Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol, 31, 1, pp. 15-25, (2017); Hoffmann M., Keck T., Mesenteriale Durchblutungsstörungen: Diagnostik Und Therapie [Management of mesenteric ischemia and mesenteric vein thrombosis], Dtsch Med Wochenschr, 139, 30, pp. 1540-1544, (2014); Wang Y., Zhao R., Xia L., Cui Y.P., Zhou Y., Wu X.T., Predictive risk factors of intestinal necrosis in patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis: Retrospective Study from a single Center, Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2019, (2019); Zhao H., Meng Y., Zhang P., Zhang Q., Wang F., Li Y., Predictors and risk factors for intestinal necrosis in patients with mesenteric ischemia.

Methods: Computer retrieval of PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for literature comparing the clinical effects of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) in treating mediastinal tumors, with the retrieval time limit from the establishment of the database to September 2023. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. Results: A total of 19 articles were included, with a total of 3517 patients. The results of the Meta-analysis showed that the RATS group had less intraoperative bleeding [MD = − 5.20, 95%CI (− 9.28, − 1.12), P = 0.01], lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy [OR = 0.41, 95%CI (0.23, 0.72), P = 0.002], lower rate of total postoperative complications [OR = 0.57, 95%CI (0.34, 0.95), P = 0.03], shorter postoperative drainage time [MD = − 0.72, 95%CI (− 1.13, − 0.32), P = 0.0004], and shorter postoperative hospital stay [MD = − 0.90, 95%CI (− 1.16, − 0.65), P < 0.001], in comparison with the VATS group. There was an insignificant difference between the two groups in terms of tumor size [MD = − 0.02, 95%CI (− 0.33, 0.30), P = 0.91] and operation time [MD = 0.17, 95%CI (− 7.61, 7.94), P = 0.97]. However, in regards to hospitalization costs [MD = 2634.75, 95%CI (991.62, 4277.88), P = 0.002], the RATS group was more expensive than the VATS group. Conclusion: Robot-assisted mediastinal tumor resection surgery has more advantages in terms of intraoperative bleeding, conversion to thoracotomy rate, total postoperative complication rate, postoperative drainage time, and postoperative hospital stay, in comparison with thoracoscopic-assisted mediastinal tumor resection surgery. There is an insignificant difference in tumor size and operation time between the two surgeries. However, robot-assisted mediastinal tumor resection surgery increases hospitalization costs. © The Author(s) 2024.",Mediastinal tumors; Meta-analysis; Robot-assisted thoracic surgery; Video-assisted thoracic surgery,"Drainage;

We designed Wi-Fi Twinge, a system that uses electrical muscle stimulation to extend human perception to sense unseen Wi-Fi signals, giving people an allergy-like twinge reaction to Wi-Fi: a superpower that can be seen as unfortunate while also having potential benefits. Through an in-the-wild study, interviews with 12 participants revealed that although the superpower from Wi-Fi Twinge induced negative feelings and impacted certain day-to-day activities, it improved awareness of self and the surrounding environment. We used these results to offer design tactics for creating future superpower systems that consider potential unfortunate side effects. Ultimately, we aim to advance our understanding of technology-facilitated superpowers.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Implementing computational thinking in elementary schools remains a challenge for education, particularly for teachers and students. Teachers must construct learning experiences using computational thinking to make the learning process more engaging, while students must solve issues logically, systematically, and effectively. This study aims to present an overview of the application of computational thinking in natural and social sciences (IPAS) learning and identify its application in fifth-grade elementary school students. The research employed a qualitative research design with a single one-shot case study. The research subjects were 40 fifth-grade students and four teachers. This investigation was conducted during a single meeting that followed the lesson plan for the force material around us. The findings revealed that (a) analysis of student activity data yielded a percentage of 81.25%; (b) the data analysis of student responses to learning yielded favorable results, approaching 100%. According to interviews and observations of CT (Computational Thinking) in SSI (Socio-scientific Issue) in IPAS subjects, implementing CT learning on the forces around us might bring up aspects of the CT foundation, such as pattern recognition decomposition, abstraction, and algorithms. The learning scenario is that students are requested to assess many types of activities that occur in everyday life. Additionally, students will outline various actions that use force. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

This can be helpful if used to support the learning process, for example by enabling students to quickly generate and contrast alternative solution approaches. However, concerns about student over-reliance and inappropriate use of LLMs in education are common. Understanding the capabilities of LLMs is essential for instructors to make informed decisions on question choices for learning and assessment tasks. In CS (Computer Science), previous evaluations of LLMs have focused on CS1 and CS2 questions, and little is known about how well LLMs perform for assessment questions in upper-level CS courses such as CG (Computer Graphics), which covers a wide variety of concepts and question types. To address this gap, we compiled a dataset of past assessment questions used in a final-year undergraduate course about introductory CG, and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 on this dataset. We also classified assessment questions and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 for different types of questions. We found that the performance tended to be best for simple mathematical questions, and worst for questions requiring creative thinking, and those with complex descriptions and/or images. We share our benchmark dataset with the community and provide new insights into the capabilities of GPT-4 in the context of CG courses. We highlight opportunities for teaching staff to improve student learning by guiding the use of LLMs for CG questions, and inform decisions around question choices for assessment tasks. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Here P is a computable predicate but g is not necessarily computable from f. In this paper we propose the following constructive version of ∀f∃g.P(f, g): for every f there is a “long enough” finite prefix g0 of g such that P(f, g0), where “long enough” is expressed by membership to a bar which is a free parameter of the constructive version. Our approach with bars generalises the approaches to Higman’s lemma undertaken by Coquand–Fridlender, Murthy–Russell and Schwichtenberg–Seisenberger–Wiesnet. As a first test for our bar technique, we sketch a constructive theory of well-quasi orders. This includes yet another constructive version of Higman’s lemma: that every infinite sequence of words has an infinite ascending subsequence. As compared with the previous constructive versions of Higman’s lemma, our constructive proofs are closer to the original classical proofs. © Stefano Berardi, Gabriele Buriola, and Peter Schuster.",bar induction; constructive mathematics; formal proof; Higman’s lemma; inductive predicate; intuitionistic logic; well quasi-order,Bar induction; Constructive mathematics; Constructive theory; Finite prefix; Formal proofs; Free parameters; Higman’s lemma; Inductive predicate; Intuitionistic logic; Well quasi orderings; Computer circuits,,,,,"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica ""Francesco Severi"", INdAM; Gruppo Nazionale per le Strutture Algebriche, Geometriche e le loro Applicazioni, GNSAGA; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Verona Vicenza Belluno e Ancona","Acknowledgements The present study was started while the third author worked within the project “Reducing complexity in algebra, logic, combinatorics – REDCOM” belonging to the programme “Ricerca Scientifica di Eccellenza 2018” of the Fondazione Cariverona.

A well-prepared and highly competent workforce is crucial to propel this evolution, making it a pivotal element for the successful future of software engineering. To instill the art and science of software engineering across diverse age groups, innovative teaching methods must be introduced at all levels of education dissemination. Software engineering stands out as one of the most dynamic subjects in computer science curricula, spanning both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, given the continuous emergence of new software development process models, methods, and tools. A comprehensive software engineering course should encompass various processes, methods, and tools necessary to support large-scale software systems’ development, operation, and maintenance. Moreover, these courses should significantly emphasize developing the interpersonal and communication skills essential for a well-rounded software engineer. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Previous research has evaluated these LLMs for various applications such as generating programming exercises and solutions. However, these evaluations have predominantly been conducted by instructors and researchers, not considering the actual usage of LLMs by students. This study adopts a student-first approach to comprehensively understand how undergraduate computer science students utilize ChatGPT, a popular LLM, released by OpenAI. We employ a combination of student surveys and interviews to obtain valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements related to ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that a majority of students (over 57%) have a convincingly positive outlook towards adopting ChatGPT as an aid in coursework-related tasks. However, our research also highlights various challenges that must be resolved for long-term acceptance of ChatGPT amongst students. The findings from this investigation have broader implications and may be applicable to other LLMs and their role in computing education. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Such tools can, in theory, provide on-demand help in large class settings and be configured with appropriate guardrails to prevent misuse and mitigate common concerns around learner over-reliance. However, the deployment of LLM-powered tools in authentic classroom settings is still rare, and very little is currently known about how students will use them in practice and what type of help they will seek. To address this, we examine students' use of an innovative LLM-powered tool that provides on-demand programming assistance without revealing solutions directly. We deployed the tool for 12 weeks in an introductory computer and data science course (n = 52), collecting more than 2,500 queries submitted by students throughout the term. We manually categorized all student queries based on the type of assistance sought, and we automatically analyzed several additional query characteristics. We found that most queries requested immediate help with programming assignments, whereas fewer requests asked for help on related concepts or for deepening conceptual understanding. Furthermore, students often provided minimal information to the tool, suggesting this is an area in which targeted instruction would be beneficial. We also found that students who achieved more success in the course tended to have used the tool more frequently overall. Lessons from this research can be leveraged by programming educators and institutions who plan to augment their teaching with emerging LLM-powered tools. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Guardrails; Intelligent programming tutors; Intelligent tutoring systems; Large language models; Natural language interfaces; Novice programmers; Programming assistance,Computational linguistics; Education computing; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Natural language processing systems; Guardrail; Intelligent programming tutor; Intelligent tutoring; Intelligent tutoring system; Language model; Large language model; Natural language interfaces; Novice programmer; Programming assistance; Programming tutors; Tutoring system; Students,,,,,,,"Balse R., Valaboju B., Singhal S., War-Riem J.M., Prasad P., Investigating the Potential of GPT-3 in Providing Feedback for Programming Assessments, Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education V. 1 (Turku, Finland) (, pp. 292-298, (2023); Becker B.A., Denny P., Finnie-Ansley J., Luxton-Reilly A., Prather J., Santos E.A., Programming Is Hard-Or at Least It Used to Be: Educational Opportunities and Challenges of AI Code Generation, Proceedings of the 54th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V, 1, pp. 500-506, (2023); Brusilovsky P., Ericson B.J., Horstmann C.S., Servin C., The Future of Computing Education Materials, (2023); Chen B., Zhang F., Nguyen A., Zan D., Lin Z., Lou J.-G., Chen W., CodeT: Code Generation with Generated Tests, (2022); Cipriano B.P., Alves P., GPT-3 vs Object Oriented Programming Assignments: An Experience Report, Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education V. 1 (Turku, Finland), pp. 61-67, (2023); Collins J.E., Policy Solutions: Policy questions for ChatGPT and artificial intelligence, Phi Delta Kappan, 104, 7, pp. 60-61, (2023); Denny P., Kumar V., Giacaman N., Conversing with Copilot: Exploring Prompt Engineering for Solving CS1 Problems Using Natural Language, Proceedings of the 54th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V, 1, pp. 1136-1142, (2023); Denny P., Leinonen J., Prather J., Luxton-Reilly A., Amarouche T., Becker B.A., Reeves B.N., Prompt Problems: A New Programming Exercise for the Generative AI Era, (2023); Denny P., Leinonen J., Prather J., Luxton-Reilly A., Amarouche T., Becker B.A., Reeves B.N., Promptly: Using Prompt Problems to Teach Learners How to Effectively Utilize AI Code Generators, (2023); Denny P., Prather J., Becker B.A., Finnie-Ansley J., Hellas A., Leinonen J., Luxton-Reilly A., Reeves B.N., Santos E.A., Sarsa S., Computing Education in the Era of Generative AI, (2023); Doughty J., Wan Z., Bompelli A., Qayum J., Wang T., Zhang J., Zheng Y., Doyle A., Sridhar P., Agarwal A., Et al., A Comparative Study of AI-Generated (GPT-4) and Human-crafted MCQs in Programming Education, (2023); Finnie-Ansley J., Denny P., Becker B.A., Luxton-Reilly A., Prather J., The robots are coming: Exploring the implications of openai codex on introductory programming, Proceedings of the 24th Australasian Computing Education Conference, pp. 10-19, (2022); Gao Z., Heckman S., Lynch C., Who Uses Office Hours?

In this paper we introduce NuzzleBug, an extension of the popular block-based programming environment Scratch that provides the missing debugging support. NuzzleBug allows controlling the executions of Scratch programs with classical debugging functionality such as stepping and breakpoints, and it is an omniscient debugger that also allows reverse stepping. To support learners in deriving hypotheses that guide debugging, NuzzleBug is an interrogative debugger that enables to ask questions about executions and provides answers explaining the behavior in question. In order to evaluate NuzzleBug, we survey the opinions of teachers, and study the effects on learners in terms of debugging effectiveness and efficiency. We find that teachers consider NuzzleBug to be useful, and children can use it to debug faulty programs effectively. However, systematic debugging requires dedicated training, and even when NuzzleBug can provide correct answers learners may require further help to comprehend faults and necessary fixes, thus calling for further research on improving debugging techniques and the information they provide. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.
