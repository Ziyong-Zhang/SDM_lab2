# SDM Lab 2: Knowledge Graph Creation with RDFLib and GraphDB

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for Lab 2 of the SDM course at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). The lab focuses on the creation and querying of a knowledge graph related to research publications using RDFLib and GraphDB.

## Repository Structure

### `data`
Contains CSV files and Turtle files used to build the ABOX and TBOX of the knowledge graph:
- `CSVs/`: Directory containing all CSV files used for the ABOX creation.
- `lab_tbox.ttl`: Turtle file containing the TBOX definition.
- `lab_abox.ttl`: Turtle file containing the ABOX definition.

### `graph`
Stores images and diagrams related to the project, store running results of queries:
- `B.1_TBOX.png`: Image showing the TBOX structure.

### `scripts`
Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for creating the TBOX and ABOX, and for running SPARQL queries:
- `1_TBOX_create.py`: Script for defining the TBOX.
- `2_ABOX_create.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for creating the ABOX.
- `4_Query.sparql`: SPARQL queries used for testing the ontology.

## Visualizations
