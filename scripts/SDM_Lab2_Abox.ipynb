Through an analysis of known lists of hijacked journals, the study identified at least 67 hijacked journals that have penetrated Scopus since 2013. Of these, 33 journals indexed unauthorized content in Scopus and 23 compromised the homepage link in the journal's profile, while 11 did both. As of September 2023, 41 hijacked journals are still compromising the data of legitimate journals in Scopus. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus is a challenge for scientific integrity due to the legitimization of unreliable papers that have not undergone peer review and compromises the quality of the Scopus database. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus has far-reaching effects. Papers published in these journals may be cited, and unauthorized content from these journals in Scopus is thus imported into other databases, including ORCID and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database. This poses a particular challenge for research evaluation in those countries, where cloned versions of approved journals may be used to acquire publications and verifying their authenticity can be difficult. \\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

However, handling the big MWD data due to multiform stacking is a time-consuming and challenging task. Extracting valuable insights and improving the accuracy of geoengineering interpretations from MWD data necessitates a combination of domain expertise and data science skills in an iterative process. To address these challenges and efficiently normalize and filter out noisy data, an automated processing approach integrating the stepwise technique, mode, and percentile gate bands for both single and peer group-based holes was developed. Subsequently, the mathematical concept of a novel normalizing index for classifying such big datasets was also presented. The visualized results from different geo-infrastructure datasets in Sweden indicated that outliers and noisy data can more efficiently be eliminated using single hole-based normalizing. Additionally, a relational unified PostgreSQL database was created to store and automatically transfer the processed and raw MWD as well as real time grouting data that offers a cost effective and efficient data extraction tool. The generated database is expected to facilitate in-depth investigations and enable application of the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict rock quality conditions and design appropriate support systems based on MWD data. \\u00a9 2024 by the authors.\",\n          \"Biometric-based identity verification systems have gained substantial attention due to their ability to provide high-level security. Among these systems, iris recognition systems have emerged as one of the most accurate and complex verification approaches. However, an ideal recognition system with a short processing time has not yet been reported in the literature because of the trade-offs involved. In this article, a novel framework for an iris recognition system is proposed based on hybrid deep neural network (DNN) classification-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction. The developed system includes unique pre-processing steps for both training and testing datasets, which are modulated by greyscale conversation, Gaussian blurring, binary imaging, contour segmentation and resizing. The proposed LDA-DNN provides high accuracy and stability for human identity verification with a short processing time. The proposed model accomplishes this task perfectly without any loss, which is unique among this type of approach. The results are validated via five computed measurement parameters. Experimental results are obtained by applying the model to four typical existing databases for powerful validation. Moreover, the proposed LDA-DNN framework results are compared with outcome measures obtained for state-of-the-art iris recognition approaches. The experimental results illustrate the success and power of the proposed LDA-DNN model, which attains an accuracy of 100% within a time of 70 ms, corresponding to an ideal recognition result that validated using several databases. Furthermore, this work provides a model within a unique property, in which it does not require a specific database or measurement parameters for evaluation. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pages\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"395-422\",\n          \"-\",\n          \"32099-32122\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1002/asi.24855\",\n          \"10.3390/s24041209\",\n          \"10.1007/s11042-023-16751-6\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177730960&doi=10.1002%2fasi.24855&partnerID=40&md5=4b2cdcf54b854ebba15671567d95a991\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185561482&doi=10.3390%2fs24041209&partnerID=40&md5=5cb27b9fe25b5c2a65a178b4b28694e7\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171424677&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-023-16751-6&partnerID=40&md5=1b9a48a4de7c702a768852ced592ace3\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 2022,\n        \"max\": 2024,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2023,\n          2022,\n          2024\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Through an analysis of known lists of hijacked journals, the study identified at least 67 hijacked journals that have penetrated Scopus since 2013. Of these, 33 journals indexed unauthorized content in Scopus and 23 compromised the homepage link in the journal's profile, while 11 did both. As of September 2023, 41 hijacked journals are still compromising the data of legitimate journals in Scopus. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus is a challenge for scientific integrity due to the legitimization of unreliable papers that have not undergone peer review and compromises the quality of the Scopus database. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus has far-reaching effects. Papers published in these journals may be cited, and unauthorized content from these journals in Scopus is thus imported into other databases, including ORCID and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database. This poses a particular challenge for research evaluation in those countries, where cloned versions of approved journals may be used to acquire publications and verifying their authenticity can be difficult. \\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

However, handling the big MWD data due to multiform stacking is a time-consuming and challenging task. Extracting valuable insights and improving the accuracy of geoengineering interpretations from MWD data necessitates a combination of domain expertise and data science skills in an iterative process. To address these challenges and efficiently normalize and filter out noisy data, an automated processing approach integrating the stepwise technique, mode, and percentile gate bands for both single and peer group-based holes was developed. Subsequently, the mathematical concept of a novel normalizing index for classifying such big datasets was also presented. The visualized results from different geo-infrastructure datasets in Sweden indicated that outliers and noisy data can more efficiently be eliminated using single hole-based normalizing. Additionally, a relational unified PostgreSQL database was created to store and automatically transfer the processed and raw MWD as well as real time grouting data that offers a cost effective and efficient data extraction tool. The generated database is expected to facilitate in-depth investigations and enable application of the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict rock quality conditions and design appropriate support systems based on MWD data. \\u00a9 2024 by the authors.\",\n          \"Biometric-based identity verification systems have gained substantial attention due to their ability to provide high-level security. Among these systems, iris recognition systems have emerged as one of the most accurate and complex verification approaches. However, an ideal recognition system with a short processing time has not yet been reported in the literature because of the trade-offs involved. In this article, a novel framework for an iris recognition system is proposed based on hybrid deep neural network (DNN) classification-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction. The developed system includes unique pre-processing steps for both training and testing datasets, which are modulated by greyscale conversation, Gaussian blurring, binary imaging, contour segmentation and resizing. The proposed LDA-DNN provides high accuracy and stability for human identity verification with a short processing time. The proposed model accomplishes this task perfectly without any loss, which is unique among this type of approach. The results are validated via five computed measurement parameters. Experimental results are obtained by applying the model to four typical existing databases for powerful validation. Moreover, the proposed LDA-DNN framework results are compared with outcome measures obtained for state-of-the-art iris recognition approaches. The experimental results illustrate the success and power of the proposed LDA-DNN model, which attains an accuracy of 100% within a time of 70 ms, corresponding to an ideal recognition result that validated using several databases. Furthermore, this work provides a model within a unique property, in which it does not require a specific database or measurement parameters for evaluation. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pages\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"395-422\",\n          \"-\",\n          \"32099-32122\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1002/asi.24855\",\n          \"10.3390/s24041209\",\n          \"10.1007/s11042-023-16751-6\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177730960&doi=10.1002%2fasi.24855&partnerID=40&md5=4b2cdcf54b854ebba15671567d95a991\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185561482&doi=10.3390%2fs24041209&partnerID=40&md5=5cb27b9fe25b5c2a65a178b4b28694e7\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171424677&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-023-16751-6&partnerID=40&md5=1b9a48a4de7c702a768852ced592ace3\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 2022,\n        \"max\": 2024,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2023,\n          2022,\n          2024\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Through an analysis of known lists of hijacked journals, the study identified at least 67 hijacked journals that have penetrated Scopus since 2013. Of these, 33 journals indexed unauthorized content in Scopus and 23 compromised the homepage link in the journal's profile, while 11 did both. As of September 2023, 41 hijacked journals are still compromising the data of legitimate journals in Scopus. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus is a challenge for scientific integrity due to the legitimization of unreliable papers that have not undergone peer review and compromises the quality of the Scopus database. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus has far-reaching effects. Papers published in these journals may be cited, and unauthorized content from these journals in Scopus is thus imported into other databases, including ORCID and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database. This poses a particular challenge for research evaluation in those countries, where cloned versions of approved journals may be used to acquire publications and verifying their authenticity can be difficult. \\u00a9 2023 The Authors. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Association for Information Science and Technology.\",\n          \"In the context of geo-infrastructures and specifically tunneling projects, analyzing the large-scale sensor-based measurement-while-drilling (MWD) data plays a pivotal role in assessing rock engineering conditions. However, handling the big MWD data due to multiform stacking is a time-consuming and challenging task. Extracting valuable insights and improving the accuracy of geoengineering interpretations from MWD data necessitates a combination of domain expertise and data science skills in an iterative process. To address these challenges and efficiently normalize and filter out noisy data, an automated processing approach integrating the stepwise technique, mode, and percentile gate bands for both single and peer group-based holes was developed. Subsequently, the mathematical concept of a novel normalizing index for classifying such big datasets was also presented. The visualized results from different geo-infrastructure datasets in Sweden indicated that outliers and noisy data can more efficiently be eliminated using single hole-based normalizing. Additionally, a relational unified PostgreSQL database was created to store and automatically transfer the processed and raw MWD as well as real time grouting data that offers a cost effective and efficient data extraction tool. The generated database is expected to facilitate in-depth investigations and enable application of the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict rock quality conditions and design appropriate support systems based on MWD data. \\u00a9 2024 by the authors.\",\n          \"Biometric-based identity verification systems have gained substantial attention due to their ability to provide high-level security. Among these systems, iris recognition systems have emerged as one of the most accurate and complex verification approaches. However, an ideal recognition system with a short processing time has not yet been reported in the literature because of the trade-offs involved. In this article, a novel framework for an iris recognition system is proposed based on hybrid deep neural network (DNN) classification-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction. The developed system includes unique pre-processing steps for both training and testing datasets, which are modulated by greyscale conversation, Gaussian blurring, binary imaging, contour segmentation and resizing. The proposed LDA-DNN provides high accuracy and stability for human identity verification with a short processing time. The proposed model accomplishes this task perfectly without any loss, which is unique among this type of approach. The results are validated via five computed measurement parameters. Experimental results are obtained by applying the model to four typical existing databases for powerful validation. Moreover, the proposed LDA-DNN framework results are compared with outcome measures obtained for state-of-the-art iris recognition approaches. The experimental results illustrate the success and power of the proposed LDA-DNN model, which attains an accuracy of 100% within a time of 70 ms, corresponding to an ideal recognition result that validated using several databases. Furthermore, this work provides a model within a unique property, in which it does not require a specific database or measurement parameters for evaluation. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pages\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"395-422\",\n          \"-\",\n          \"32099-32122\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1002/asi.24855\",\n          \"10.3390/s24041209\",\n          \"10.1007/s11042-023-16751-6\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177730960&doi=10.1002%2fasi.24855&partnerID=40&md5=4b2cdcf54b854ebba15671567d95a991\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185561482&doi=10.3390%2fs24041209&partnerID=40&md5=5cb27b9fe25b5c2a65a178b4b28694e7\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171424677&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-023-16751-6&partnerID=40&md5=1b9a48a4de7c702a768852ced592ace3\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 2022,\n        \"max\": 2024,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2023,\n          2022,\n          2024\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Through an analysis of known lists of hijacked journals, the study identified at least 67 hijacked journals that have penetrated Scopus since 2013. Of these, 33 journals indexed unauthorized content in Scopus and 23 compromised the homepage link in the journal's profile, while 11 did both. As of September 2023, 41 hijacked journals are still compromising the data of legitimate journals in Scopus. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus is a challenge for scientific integrity due to the legitimization of unreliable papers that have not undergone peer review and compromises the quality of the Scopus database. The presence of hijacked journals in Scopus has far-reaching effects. Papers published in these journals may be cited, and unauthorized content from these journals in Scopus is thus imported into other databases, including ORCID and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database. This poses a particular challenge for research evaluation in those countries, where cloned versions of approved journals may be used to acquire publications and verifying their authenticity can be difficult. \\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

However, handling the big MWD data due to multiform stacking is a time-consuming and challenging task. Extracting valuable insights and improving the accuracy of geoengineering interpretations from MWD data necessitates a combination of domain expertise and data science skills in an iterative process. To address these challenges and efficiently normalize and filter out noisy data, an automated processing approach integrating the stepwise technique, mode, and percentile gate bands for both single and peer group-based holes was developed. Subsequently, the mathematical concept of a novel normalizing index for classifying such big datasets was also presented. The visualized results from different geo-infrastructure datasets in Sweden indicated that outliers and noisy data can more efficiently be eliminated using single hole-based normalizing. Additionally, a relational unified PostgreSQL database was created to store and automatically transfer the processed and raw MWD as well as real time grouting data that offers a cost effective and efficient data extraction tool. The generated database is expected to facilitate in-depth investigations and enable application of the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict rock quality conditions and design appropriate support systems based on MWD data. \\u00a9 2024 by the authors.\",\n          \"Biometric-based identity verification systems have gained substantial attention due to their ability to provide high-level security. Among these systems, iris recognition systems have emerged as one of the most accurate and complex verification approaches. However, an ideal recognition system with a short processing time has not yet been reported in the literature because of the trade-offs involved. In this article, a novel framework for an iris recognition system is proposed based on hybrid deep neural network (DNN) classification-based Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction. The developed system includes unique pre-processing steps for both training and testing datasets, which are modulated by greyscale conversation, Gaussian blurring, binary imaging, contour segmentation and resizing. The proposed LDA-DNN provides high accuracy and stability for human identity verification with a short processing time. The proposed model accomplishes this task perfectly without any loss, which is unique among this type of approach. The results are validated via five computed measurement parameters. Experimental results are obtained by applying the model to four typical existing databases for powerful validation. Moreover, the proposed LDA-DNN framework results are compared with outcome measures obtained for state-of-the-art iris recognition approaches. The experimental results illustrate the success and power of the proposed LDA-DNN model, which attains an accuracy of 100% within a time of 70 ms, corresponding to an ideal recognition result that validated using several databases. Furthermore, this work provides a model within a unique property, in which it does not require a specific database or measurement parameters for evaluation. \\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pages\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"395-422\",\n          \"-\",\n          \"32099-32122\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1002/asi.24855\",\n          \"10.3390/s24041209\",\n          \"10.1007/s11042-023-16751-6\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177730960&doi=10.1002%2fasi.24855&partnerID=40&md5=4b2cdcf54b854ebba15671567d95a991\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185561482&doi=10.3390%2fs24041209&partnerID=40&md5=5cb27b9fe25b5c2a65a178b4b28694e7\",\n          \"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171424677&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-023-16751-6&partnerID=40&md5=1b9a48a4de7c702a768852ced592ace3\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 2022,\n        \"max\": 2024,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2023,\n          2022,\n          2024\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In contrast, we devise an algorithm which performs offline sampling of a minimal set-of few-shots from the training data, with complete coverage of SQL clauses, operators and functions, and maximal domain coverage within the allowed token length. This allows for synthesis of a fixed Generic Prompt (GP), with a diverse set-of exemplars common across NL test queries, avoiding expensive test time exemplar retrieval. We further auto-adapt the GP to the target database domain (DA-GP), to better handle cross-domain generalization; followed by a decomposed Least-To-Most-Prompting (LTMP-DA-GP) to handle cross-compositional generalization. The synthesis of LTMP-DA-GP is an offline task, to be performed one-time per new database with minimal human intervention. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the KaggleDBQA dataset, designed to evaluate generalizability for the Text-to-SQL task. We further showcase consistent performance improvement of LTMP-DA-GP over GP, across LLMs and databases of KaggleDBQA, highlighting the efficacy and model agnostic benefits of our prompt based adapt and decompose approach. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.'))\n",
